# League-of-legends-catalogue
    This is simple and only for educational purpose, catalogue reference to world wide game: League Of Legends.
    I use official the story, images and names of their champions to represent functionality with React JS and CSS code.
    In this catalogue, user can create, edit, delete and design his own champions.
    Every user can rate the champions to see how loved is their favourite character from the game.

Roadmap : 
    The catalogue will expand to NFT marketplace with virtual wallet and functions to buy,sell or rent the champions you like,
only again with purpose of demonstration in learning course.
